# Customer-API-
This will predict the likelihood of a customer returning to the departmental store, and the likelihood of them buying the same product/service, as well as recommend products that will increase the store revenue.

To use the model, the subscribers would send a request to the API with the customer's purchase history and other relevant features. The API would then use the model to predict the likelihood of the customer returning to the store and the likelihood of them buying the same product/service. The API would also recommend products that the customer is likely to be interested in.

This would print the following output:

0.8
0.7
['product_4', 'product_5', 'product_6']

The subscribers could then use this information to improve their customer experience and increase their revenue. For example, they could send targeted marketing messages to customers who are likely to return to the store, or they could recommend products to customers based on their purchase history and the products that are most popular with similar customers.
